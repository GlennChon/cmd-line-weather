## Requirements:

The code should be self-documenting, although you can use comments to convey the reason for your design decisions.

Make sure you commit your progress in a sensible way, if you're doing TDD you should start with tests.

You'll be evaluated on:

- Code consistency and naming conventions

- Use of reactive/functional paradigm

- Code abstraction

- Error Handling

- Testing

- Git commiting
